## What is mlr3proba ?

**mlr3proba** is a probabilistic supervised learning (PSL) toolkit for machine learning in R utilising the
**[mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3)** package. Probabilistic supervised learning is a field of supervised machine
learning in which probability distributions are predicted. The most common variant of this is
survival analysis, where the task of interest is to predict an individual's survival curve. Other forms
of PSL include density estimation and probabilistic regression. To-date, PSL toolkits in R has
been limited to Bayesian simulation packages, but **mlr3proba** hopes to change this.

## Installation

Install the last release from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mlr3proba")
```

Install the development version from GitHub:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/mlr3proba")
```

## Example

### Train and Predict

```{r}
library(mlr3proba)
library(mlr3)
library(survival)
set.seed(1)

# create task and learner

veteran = mlr3misc::load_dataset("veteran", package = "survival")
task_veteran = TaskSurv$new(id = "veteran", backend = veteran, time = "time", event = "status")
learner = lrn("surv.coxph")

# train/test split 

train_set = sample(task_veteran$nrow, 0.8 * task_veteran$nrow)
test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task_veteran$nrow), train_set)

# fit Cox PH and inspect model

learner$train(task_veteran, row_ids = train_set)
learner$model

# make predictions for new data

prediction = learner$predict(task_veteran, row_ids = test_set)
prediction
```

### Evaluate - crank, lp, and distr

Every `PredictionSurv` object can predict one or more of:

* `lp` - Linear predictor calculated as the fitted coefficients multiplied by the test data.
* `distr` - Predicted survival distribution, either discrete or continuous. Implemented in **[distr6](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distr6/)**.
* `crank` - Continuous ranking. This is either the same as `lp` or the expectation of `distr`.

`lp` and `crank` can be used with measures of discrimination such as the concordance index. Whilst
`lp` is a specific mathematical prediction, `crank` is any continuous ranking that identifies who is
more or less likely to experience the event. So far, the only implemented learner that only returns a continuous
ranking is `surv.svm`. If a `PredictionSurv` returns an `lp` then the `crank` is identical to this.
Otherwise `crank` is calculated as the expectation of the predicted survival distribution. Note that 
for linear proportional hazards models, the ranking (but not necessarily the `crank` score itself)
given by `lp` and the expected `distr`, is identical.

```{r}
# In the previous example, Cox model predicts `lp` so `crank` is identical

all(prediction$lp == prediction$crank)
prediction$lp[1:10]

# These are evaluated with measures of discrimination and calibration. As all PredictionSurv objects
# will return crank, Harrell's C is the default measure.

prediction$score()

# distr is evaluated with probabilistic scoring rules.

measure = lapply(c("surv.graf", "surv.grafSE", "surv.intlogloss", "surv.intloglossSE",
                   "surv.logloss", "surv.loglossSE"), msr)
prediction$score(measure)

# Often measures can be integrated over mutliple time-points, or return predictions for single time-points

measure = msr("surv.graf", times = 60)
prediction$score(measure)
```

## Feature Overview and Lifecycle

The vision of **mlr3proba** is to be the first complete probabilistic machine learning package in R. This encompasses survival analysis, probabilistic regression (not just via MCMC\!), and unsupervised density estimation. The first release of **mlr3proba** is focused entirely on survival analysis and introduces `TaskSurv`. Later releases will include `TaskDensity` and will extend `TaskRegr` to have probabilistic predict types. The lifecycle of the survival task and features are considered `maturing` and any major changes are unlikely. The density and probabilistic regression tasks are currently in the early stages of development. The current main features of **mlr3proba** are:

* The added `TaskSurv`, `LearnerSurv`, `PredictionSurv` for survival analysis
* 17 survival learners, and 21 survival measures, including efficient implementations of censoring-adjusted probabilistic measures, such as the Integrated Graf (or Brier) Score.
* PipeOps integrated with **[mlr3pipelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines)** for composition of probability distributions from linear predictors

## Future Plans

* Add `TaskDensity`, `PredictionDensity`, `LearnerDensity`, and associated learners/measures
* Add `prob` predict type to `TaskRegr`, and associated learners/measures
* Allow `MeasureSurv` to return measures at multiple time-points simultaneously
* Improve estimation of integrated scores, and re-implement **[survAUC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survAUC)** scores in **mlr3proba**
* Continue to add survival measures and learners

## Bugs, Questions, Feedback

**mlr3proba** is a free and open source software project that
encourages participation and feedback. If you have any issues,
questions, suggestions or feedback, please do not hesitate to open an
“issue” about it on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3proba/issues)\!

In case of problems / bugs, it is often helpful if you provide a
“minimum working example” that showcases the behaviour (but don’t
worry about this if the bug is obvious).

Please understand that the resources of the project are limited:
response may sometimes be delayed by a few days, and some feature
suggestions may be rejected if they are deemed too tangential to the
vision behind the project.

## Similar Projects

A predecessor to this package is **[mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr)**, using the survival task. Several packages exist for pure Bayesian probabilistic modelling, including **[jags](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)** and **[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan)**. For implementation of a few survival models and measures, the largest package is **[survival](https://github.com/therneau/survival)**. There does not appear to be a package that implements many different variants of density estimation, but see **[this list](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/density-estimation.pdf)** for the biggest density estimation packages in R.
